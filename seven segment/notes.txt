Cathode side:
Use [6:0] seg to change the 7-segment value.
Left most bit represents G segment.
Right most bit represents A segment.
1 will turn off that segment.
0 will turn on that segment.
So seg = 7'b1000000 will give the hexadecimal number 0.

Anode side:
Use [7:0] an to change which 7-segments are shown and which ones are not shown.
Left most bit represents the left most 7-segment.
Right most bit represents the right most 7-segment.
1 will turn off that 7-segment.
0 will turn on that 7-segment.
So an = 8'b11111110 will only show the right most 7-segment.
